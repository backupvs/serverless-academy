## About app

Program that tranforms vacations array to users array in JSON file.

## Task

Let's imagine we have a JSON file with a list of developers. Each has a unique id, name, as well as different vacation periods and other information. This data we need to format into a more convenient and universal form.

In the original JSON, in a situation where the user has multiple vacation periods, this information is output as a separate object for with the user name repeated.

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "6196a33a3a853300128602eb",
    "user": {
      "_id": "60b7c1f04df06a0011ef0e76",
      "name": "Laurence Knox"
    },
    "usedDays": 3,
    "startDate": "2021-11-19",
    "endDate": "2021-11-23"
  },
  {
    "_id": "61a3c3bb3a85330012864b5b",
    "user": {
      "_id": "60b7c1f04df06a0011ef0e76",
      "name": "Laurence Knox"
    },
    "usedDays": 2,
    "startDate": "2021-12-09",
    "endDate": "2021-12-10"
  }
]
```

_This is an example that shows that one user can have multiple vacation records._

👉You can find the original JSON [here](https://jsonbase.com/sls-team/vacations).

#### Requirements

As a result we should transform the original JSON in the following way:

1.  User must occur **once** in JSON regardless of the number of vacations taken;
2.  The user should have **an array of vacations** with relevant information, in a nice and readable way;
3.  In the resulting JSON there should be only the following keys: **userId**, **userName**, and **vacations**.

An ideal result must have the following structure:

```json
[
  {
    "userId": "60b7c1f04df06a0011ef0e76",
    "userName": "Laurence Knox",
    "vacations": [
      {
        "startDate": "2021-11-19",
        "endDate": "2021-11-23"
      },
      {
        "startDate": "2021-12-09",
        "endDate": "2021-12-10"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## To start the application:

```
